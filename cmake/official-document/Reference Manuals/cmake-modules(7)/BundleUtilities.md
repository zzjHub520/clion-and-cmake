# BundleUtilities

Functions to help assemble a standalone bundle application.

A collection of CMake utility functions useful for dealing with `.app` bundles on the Mac and bundle-like directories on any OS.

The following functions are provided by this module:

```cmake
fixup_bundle
copy_and_fixup_bundle
verify_app
get_bundle_main_executable
get_dotapp_dir
get_bundle_and_executable
get_bundle_all_executables
get_item_key
get_item_rpaths
clear_bundle_keys
set_bundle_key_values
get_bundle_keys
copy_resolved_item_into_bundle
copy_resolved_framework_into_bundle
fixup_bundle_item
verify_bundle_prerequisites
verify_bundle_symlinks
```

Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function, break and `PARENT_SCOPE`. Also depends on `GetPrerequisites.cmake`.

DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS AT CONFIGURE TIME (from `CMakeLists.txt`)! Instead, invoke them from an [`install(CODE)`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/install.html#command:install) or [`install(SCRIPT)`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/install.html#command:install) rule.

```cmake
fixup_bundle(<app> <libs> <dirs>)
```

Fix up `<app>` bundle in-place and make it standalone, such that it can be drag-n-drop copied to another machine and run on that machine as long as all of the system libraries are compatible.

If you pass plugins to `fixup_bundle` as the libs parameter, you should install them or copy them into the bundle before calling `fixup_bundle`. The `<libs>` parameter is a list of libraries that must be fixed up, but that cannot be determined by `otool` output analysis (i.e. `plugins`).

Gather all the keys for all the executables and libraries in a bundle, and then, for each key, copy each prerequisite into the bundle. Then fix each one up according to its own list of prerequisites.

Then clear all the keys and call `verify_app` on the final bundle to ensure that it is truly standalone.

*New in version 3.6:* As an optional parameter (`IGNORE_ITEM`) a list of file names can be passed, which are then ignored (e.g. `IGNORE_ITEM "vcredist_x86.exe;vcredist_x64.exe"`).

```cmake
copy_and_fixup_bundle(<src> <dst> <libs> <dirs>)
```

Makes a copy of the bundle `<src>` at location `<dst>` and then fixes up the new copied bundle in-place at `<dst>`.

```cmake
verify_app(<app>)
```

Verifies that an application `<app>` appears valid based on running analysis tools on it. Calls [`message(FATAL_ERROR)`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/message.html#command:message) if the application is not verified.

*New in version 3.6:* As an optional parameter (`IGNORE_ITEM`) a list of file names can be passed, which are then ignored (e.g. `IGNORE_ITEM "vcredist_x86.exe;vcredist_x64.exe"`)

```cmake
get_bundle_main_executable(<bundle> <result_var>)
```

The result will be the full path name of the bundle's main executable file or an `error:` prefixed string if it could not be determined.

```cmake
get_dotapp_dir(<exe> <dotapp_dir_var>)
```

Returns the nearest parent dir whose name ends with `.app` given the full path to an executable. If there is no such parent dir, then simply return the dir containing the executable.

The returned directory may or may not exist.

```cmake
get_bundle_and_executable(<app> <bundle_var> <executable_var> <valid_var>)
```

Takes either a `.app` directory name or the name of an executable nested inside a `.app` directory and returns the path to the `.app` directory in `<bundle_var>` and the path to its main executable in `<executable_var>`.

```cmake
get_bundle_all_executables(<bundle> <exes_var>)
```

Scans `<bundle>` bundle recursively for all `<exes_var>` executable files and accumulates them into a variable.

```cmake
get_item_key(<item> <key_var>)
```

Given `<item>` file name, generate `<key_var>` key that should be unique considering the set of libraries that need copying or fixing up to make a bundle standalone. This is essentially the file name including extension with `.` replaced by `_`

This key is used as a prefix for CMake variables so that we can associate a set of variables with a given item based on its key.

```cmake
clear_bundle_keys(<keys_var>)
```

Loop over the `<keys_var>` list of keys, clearing all the variables associated with each key. After the loop, clear the list of keys itself.

Caller of `get_bundle_keys` should call `clear_bundle_keys` when done with list of keys.

```cmake
set_bundle_key_values(<keys_var> <context> <item> <exepath> <dirs>
                      <copyflag> [<rpaths>])
```

Add `<keys_var>` key to the list (if necessary) for the given item. If added, also set all the variables associated with that key.

```cmake
get_bundle_keys(<app> <libs> <dirs> <keys_var>)
```

Loop over all the executable and library files within `<app>` bundle (and given as extra `<libs>`) and accumulate a list of keys representing them. Set values associated with each key such that we can loop over all of them and copy prerequisite libs into the bundle and then do appropriate `install_name_tool` fixups.

*New in version 3.6:* As an optional parameter (`IGNORE_ITEM`) a list of file names can be passed, which are then ignored (e.g. `IGNORE_ITEM "vcredist_x86.exe;vcredist_x64.exe"`)

```cmake
copy_resolved_item_into_bundle(<resolved_item> <resolved_embedded_item>)
```

Copy a resolved item into the bundle if necessary. Copy is not necessary, if the `<resolved_item>` is "the same as" the `<resolved_embedded_item>`.

```cmake
copy_resolved_framework_into_bundle(<resolved_item> <resolved_embedded_item>)
```

Copy a resolved framework into the bundle if necessary. Copy is not necessary, if the `<resolved_item>` is "the same as" the `<resolved_embedded_item>`.

By default, `BU_COPY_FULL_FRAMEWORK_CONTENTS` is not set. If you want full frameworks embedded in your bundles, set `BU_COPY_FULL_FRAMEWORK_CONTENTS` to `ON` before calling fixup_bundle. By default, `COPY_RESOLVED_FRAMEWORK_INTO_BUNDLE` copies the framework dylib itself plus the framework `Resources` directory.

```cmake
fixup_bundle_item(<resolved_embedded_item> <exepath> <dirs>)
```

Get the direct/non-system prerequisites of the `<resolved_embedded_item>`. For each prerequisite, change the way it is referenced to the value of the `_EMBEDDED_ITEM` keyed variable for that prerequisite. (Most likely changing to an `@executable_path` style reference.)

This function requires that the `<resolved_embedded_item>` be `inside` the bundle already. In other words, if you pass plugins to `fixup_bundle` as the libs parameter, you should install them or copy them into the bundle before calling `fixup_bundle`. The `libs` parameter is a list of libraries that must be fixed up, but that cannot be determined by otool output analysis. (i.e., `plugins`)

Also, change the id of the item being fixed up to its own `_EMBEDDED_ITEM` value.

Accumulate changes in a local variable and make *one* call to `install_name_tool` at the end of the function with all the changes at once.

If the `BU_CHMOD_BUNDLE_ITEMS` variable is set then bundle items will be marked writable before `install_name_tool` tries to change them.

```cmake
verify_bundle_prerequisites(<bundle> <result_var> <info_var>)
```

Verifies that the sum of all prerequisites of all files inside the bundle are contained within the bundle or are `system` libraries, presumed to exist everywhere.

*New in version 3.6:* As an optional parameter (`IGNORE_ITEM`) a list of file names can be passed, which are then ignored (e.g. `IGNORE_ITEM "vcredist_x86.exe;vcredist_x64.exe"`)

```cmake
verify_bundle_symlinks(<bundle> <result_var> <info_var>)
```

Verifies that any symlinks found in the `<bundle>` bundle point to other files that are already also in the bundle... Anything that points to an external file causes this function to fail the verification.
