# AndroidTestUtilities

*New in version 3.7.*

Create a test that automatically loads specified data onto an Android device.

## Introduction

Use this module to push data needed for testing an Android device behavior onto a connected Android device. The module will accept files and libraries as well as separate destinations for each. It will create a test that loads the files into a device object store and link to them from the specified destination. The files are only uploaded if they are not already in the object store.

For example:

```cmake
include(AndroidTestUtilities)
android_add_test_data(
  example_setup_test
  FILES <files>...
  LIBS <libs>...
  DEVICE_TEST_DIR "/data/local/tests/example"
  DEVICE_OBJECT_STORE "/sdcard/.ExternalData/SHA"
  )
```

At build time a test named "example_setup_test" will be created. Run this test on the command line with [`ctest(1)`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#manual:ctest(1)) to load the data onto the Android device.

## Module Functions

- **android_add_test_data**

  ```cmake
  android_add_test_data(<test-name>
    [FILES <files>...] [FILES_DEST <device-dir>]
    [LIBS <libs>...]   [LIBS_DEST <device-dir>]
    [DEVICE_OBJECT_STORE <device-dir>]
    [DEVICE_TEST_DIR <device-dir>]
    [NO_LINK_REGEX <strings>...]
    )
  ```

  The `android_add_test_data` function is used to copy files and libraries needed to run project-specific tests. On the host operating system, this is done at build time. For on-device testing, the files are loaded onto the device by the manufactured test at run time.

  This function accepts the following named parameters:

  - `FILES <files>...`

    zero or more files needed for testing

  - `LIBS <libs>...`

    zero or more libraries needed for testing

  - `FILES_DEST <device-dir>`

    absolute path where the data files are expected to be

  - `LIBS_DEST <device-dir>`

    absolute path where the libraries are expected to be

  - `DEVICE_OBJECT_STORE <device-dir>`

    absolute path to the location where the data is stored on-device

  - `DEVICE_TEST_DIR <device-dir>`

    absolute path to the root directory of the on-device test location

  - `NO_LINK_REGEX <strings>...`

    list of regex strings matching the names of files that should be copied from the object store to the testing directory
